# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical procedure that utilizes an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Introduction to PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. PCA is highly effective in dealing with multicollinearity in data, reducing high-dimensional data sets to lower dimensions while retaining most of the original data variance.

### How It Works

1. **Standardization**: The first step is to standardize the range of the continuous initial variables so that each one of them contributes equally to the analysis.
2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**: Compute the covariance matrix to identify correlations.
3. **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed from the covariance matrix to identify the principal components.
4. **Sort Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order to rank the corresponding eigenvectors.
5. **Select Principal Components**: Select a subset of the eigenvectors as principal components.

### Mathematical Background

The mathematical formulation of PCA is based on the solution of the eigenvector problem for the covariance matrix derived from the data set. Mathematically, PCA seeks to solve:

$$
Cv = \lambda v
$$

where C is the covariance matrix, v represents the eigenvectors, and $\lambda$ represents the eigenvalues.
