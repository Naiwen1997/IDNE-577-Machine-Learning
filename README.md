# INDE 577 — Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository encompasses an advanced industrial engineering course that delves into the core principles of data science and machine learning.

Machine learning involves the art of enabling computers to autonomously learn from data, meaning they gain knowledge without explicit programming. This field is invaluable for streamlining tasks that traditionally require extensive manual tuning or complex rule sets, solving intricate problems, adapting to dynamic environments with fresh data, and handling vast data volumes.

### Instructor: Dr. Randy Davila

### Student: Naiwen Pang

### Email: np55@rice.edu

### Course Description: 
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but will also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. Files in this repository are Jupyter Notebook projects demonstrating machine learning algorithms learned in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository primarily contains supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.This class also includes data science practices including Python Programming, Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, Version Control with Git and Github, Data Visualization.

The topics in this course primarily focus on 2 categories:
