### Instructor: Dr. Randy Davila

### Student: Naiwen Pang

### Email: np55@rice.edu

### Office: Kraft Hall 446

### Textbook:
* (Required) Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron

### Course Description: 
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but will also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. 

The topics in this course primarily fall into 3 categories: 
Topics List:

- **Data Science Practices**:
    - Python Programming
    - Jupyter Notebooks
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Version Control with Git and Github
    - Data Visualization
