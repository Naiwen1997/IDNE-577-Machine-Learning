# Single Neuron Linear Regression for Predicting Concrete Strength

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a single neuron linear regression model to predict the compressive strength of concrete, measured in MPa (Mega Pascals), based on various concrete composition features like cement, ash, water, and others. The implementation is crafted from scratch, showcasing the fundamental concepts of linear regression in a neural network-like architecture using Python.

## Linear Regression Model
Linear regression is employed to predict a continuous variable using a linear function defined by weight parameters. In this context, a single neuron in a neural network framework represents the regression model, which is illustrated as follows:

### Mathematical Formulation
The linear model predicts the target variable y  as a linear combination of the input features $\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \)$:

$y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n$

where $w_0$ is the bias and $=w_1=$ to $=w_n=$ are the weight coefficients.

### Optimization via Gradient Descent
The model parameters are optimized by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) cost function:

$J(w) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{pred}[i] - y[i])^{2}$

The gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights are calculated as:

$\frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{n} X^{T} (y_{pred} - y)$

Updates to the model parameters are made using the gradient descent rule:

$w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

## Getting Started
Instructions for setting up, running the model, and viewing results are provided in the project repository. These include how to load the dataset, execute the model training, and evaluate the model's performance.
